Instructions 
for 
Authors 


Our 
editorial 
team 
is 
committed 
to 
maintaining 
RACP 
as 
an 
excellent 
outlet 
for 
scientific 
publications 
on 
clinical 
mental 
health. 
Submissions 
from 
all 
countries 
will 
be 
considered. 
The 
journal 
publishes 
original 
articles 
covering 
a 
wide 
array 
of 
topics 
on 
clinical 
mental 
health, 
evaluation, 
and 
therapeutic 
approaches 
(theoretical 
models 
and 
clinical 
applications). 
RACP 
is 
going 
through 
a 
transition 
period, 
aiming 
to 
reach 
a 
more 
international 
audience, 
and 
increase 
its 
impact. 
Previously 
published 
in 
Spanish, 
it 
now 
only 
accepts 
submissions 
in 
English, 
the 
Academic 
Lingua 
Franca 
in 
scientific 
publications 


After 
submission 
all 
papers 
will 
be 
evaluated 
by 
the 
Editor-in-Chief 
and 
an 
Associate 
Editor 
for 
suitability 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
journal 
thereby 
providing 
a 
rapid 
response 
so 
that 
authors 
do 
not 
have 
to 
wait 
unduly. 
After 
the 
initial 
screen, 
papers 
will 
be 
sent 
for 
external. 
peer 
review. 
Following 
the 
review, 
the 
Editor-in-Chief 
and 
the 
Associate 
Editor 
will 
make 
a 
joint 
decision 
on 
acceptance, 
revision, 
or 
rejection. 
Resubmission 
of 
rejected 
manuscripts 
will 
not 
be 
allowed. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
a 
decision 
of 
revision, 
the 
author 
will 
have 
a 
stipulated 
time 
to 
resubmit 
the 
revised 
article 
with 
a 
detailed 
response 
addressing 
all 
the 
comments 
made 
by 
the 
reviewer 
and/or 
editor. 
RACP 
reviews 
are 
always 
offered 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
constructive 
criticism, 
independently 
of 
the 
final 
recommendation 
and 
we 
hope 
that 
contributors 
will 
accept 
them 
as 
such. 


RACP 
will 
be 
publishing 
editorials, 
research 
reports, 
brief 
reports, 
reviews, 
systematic 
reviews, 
commentaries, 
perspectives, 
and 
special 
articles 
some 
of 
which 
may 
be 
commissioned. 
Research 
Reports 
articles 
are 
restricted 
to 
4,000 
words 
in 
the 
main 
text, 
excluding 
references, 
tables, 
figures, 
abstract, 
acknowledgment, 
and 
disclosures. 
Brief 
Reports 
articles 
are 
for 
preliminary 
new 
findings 
(i.e., 
pilot 
studies, 
study 
protocols), 
being 
restricted 
to 
2,000 
words 
in 
the 
main 
text, 
excluding 
references, 
tables, 
figures, 
abstract, 
acknowledgment, 
and 
disclosures. 
Reviews 
are 
limited 
to 
6,000 
words, 
and 
synthesize 
the 
scientific 
knowledge 
on 
a 
specific 
topic 
in 
an 
academic 
and 
clinically 
significant 
style. 
There 
are 
no 
word-limit 
for 
Systematic 
Reviews, 
which 
are 
preferred 
than 
reviews 
although 
narrative 
reviews 
may 
be 
considered. 
Authors 
are 
required 
to 
register 
their 
systematic 
reviews 
in 
an 
appropriate 
registry, 
such 
as 
PROSPERO 
to 
certify 
fullness 
of 
reporting, 
and 
avoiding 
duplication 
of 
efforts. 
Editorials 
are 
generally 
commissioned 
by 
the 
journal. 
Commentaries 
and 
Perspectives 
are 
not 
mini-reviews, 
being 
usually 
commissioned 
by 
the 
journal. 
Commentaries 
are 
briefly 
focused 
papers 
of 
contemporary 
importance, 
limited 
to 
1,000 
words. 
Perspectives 
are 
overviews 
of 
a 
specific 
topic 
of 
clinical 
mental 
health, 
in 
which 
there 
is 
limited 
literature 
and/or 
controversy, 
being 
limited 
to 
2,000 
words. 
Special 
articles 
discuss 
specific 
clinical 
mental 
health 
issues, 
including 
critical 
assessments 
of 
literature 
and 
data 
sources, 
critically 
reviewing 
and 
evaluating 
existing 
knowledge 
and 
are 
less 
broad 
than 
review 
articles, 
being 
limited 
to 
4,000 
words. 
There 
will 
be 
no 
limits 
for 
the 
number 
of 
references, 
which 
should 
be 
cited 
and 
listed 
using 
the 
APA 
style 
(APA, 
2020).

Reviews, 
Systematic

and 
Special 
Articles, 
following 
the

data, 
an

be 
added 
(250-350 
words 
in 
English). 
The 
abstract 
should 
be 
structured 
as 
follows: 
background; 
methods; 
results; 
and 
conclusion. 
7. 
Below 
the

numbered 
consecutively

9. 
We 
recommend 
authors 
to 
follow 
reporting 
health 
research 
guidelines. 
These 
tools 
stipulate 
a 
list 
of 
criteria 
required 
for 
a 
comprehensive 
and 
flawless 
description 
of 
study 
methods 
and 
consequent 
results. 
Observance 
to 
these 
guidelines 
increases 
the 
accurateness 
and 
clearness 
of 
publications. 
RACP 
strongly 
recommends 
the
